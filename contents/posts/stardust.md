  Look, no one ever said Jotaro Kujo was a nice guy. I beat the crap out of
  people, more than I have to. Some are even still in the hospital. I've had
  idiot teachers who like to talk big, so I taught them a lesson, and they never
  came back to class. If I go to a restaurant and the food's bad, I make it a
  policy to stiff 'em with the bill. But, even a bastard like me... can spot
  true evil when he sees it! True evil are those who use the weak for their own
  gain, and crush them underfoot when they're through! Especially an innocent
  woman! And that is exactly what you've done, isn't it!? And your Stand gets to
  hide from the victim, the law, and the consequences! That's why... I will
  judge you myself!
